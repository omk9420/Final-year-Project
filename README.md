Real-Time Monitoring of Tango Based GMRT Hardware  System
The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), located near Pune, Junnar, 
near Narayangaon at Khodad in India, is an array of thirty fully steerable parabolic radio 
telescopes of 45 metre diameter, observing at metre wavelengths. It is operated by the 
National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), a part of the Tata Institute of 
Fundamental Research, Mumbai. It was conceived and built under the direction of Late 
Prof. Govind Swarup during 1984 to 1996. It is an interferometric array with baselines 
of up to 25 kilometres.
The number and configuration of the dishes was optimized to meet the principal 
astrophysical objectives which require sensitivity at high angular resolution as well as 
ability to image radio emission from diffuse extended regions. Fourteen of the thirty 
dishes are located more or less randomly in a compact central array in a region of about 
1 sq. km. The remaining sixteen dishes are spread out along the 3 arms of an 
approximately `Y'-shaped configuration over a much larger region, with the longest 
interferometric baseline of about 25 km.
Although GMRT will be a very versatile instrument for investigating a variety of 
radio astrophysical problems ranging from our nearby Solar system to the edge of the 
observable Universe, two of its most important astrophysical objectives are: 
• to detect the highly redshifted spectral line of neutral Hydrogen expected from 
protoclusters or protogalaxies before they condensed to form galaxies in the 
early phase of the Universe and 
• to search for and study rapidly-rotating Pulsars in our galaxy
